<h1>AN ADDRESS<br />

<p class="cnobmargin">ISSUED BY AN ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION OF</p>
<p class="cnomargins">AMERICAN WOMEN,</p>
<p class="cnotmargin">Held in the City of New-York, by adjournments from 9th to 12th May, 1837.</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">NEW-YORK:</p>

<h2>AN ADDRESS<br />
TO<br />
FREE COLORED AMERICANS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Brethren and Sisters</span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The sympathy we feel for our oppressed fellow-citizens
who are enslaved in these United States, has called us
together, to devise by mutual conference the best means
for bringing our guilty country to a sense of her transgressions;
and to implore the God of the oppressed to
guide and bless our labors on behalf of our &quot;countrymen
in chains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All of us have some idea what slavery is: we have
formed some faint conceptions of the horrors of a system
based on irresponsible power, violence, and injustice; but
<i>to know</i> what slavery is, we must see it worked out in
practice&mdash;we must see the heart-strings severed one by
one, and witness all the refinement of cruelty which is
exercised on the body, soul, and mind of the enslaved.
&quot;Let any man of feeling,&quot; says a Southern gentleman,
&quot;cast his thoughts over this land of slavery, think of
the nakedness of some, the hungry yearnings of others,
the wailings and wo, the bloody cut of the keen lash, and
the frightful scream that rends the very skies&mdash;and all
this to gratify lust, pride, avarice, and other depraved
feelings of the human heart. THE WORST IS NOT
GENERALLY KNOWN. Were all the miseries and
horrors of slavery to burst at once into view, a peal of
seven-fold thunder could scarce strike greater alarm.&quot;
(Swain&#39;s Address, 1830.)</p>

<p class="indent">We can readily believe this testimony to the physical
sufferings of the slave: we apprehend these most easily,
because all of us are alive to bodily pain, whilst few comparatively
appreciate the mental and spiritual degradation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
to which our oppressed brethren are subjected; yet this is
the most appalling feature of American bondage. Slavery
seizes a rational and immortal being crowned by Jehovah
with glory and honor, and drags him down to a level with
the beasts that perish. It makes him a thing, a chattel
personal, a machine to be used to all intents and purposes
for the benefit of another, without reference to the good,
the happiness, or the wishes of the man himself. It introduces
violence and disorder, where God established
harmony and peace. It would annihilate the individual
worth and responsibility conferred upon man by his Creator.
It deprives him of the power of self-improvement,
to which he is bound by the unchangeable laws of his
Maker. It prevents him from laboring in a sphere to
which his capacities are adapted. It abrogates the seventh
commandment, by annulling the obligations of marriage,
and obliging the slaves to live in a state of promiscuous
intercourse, concubinage, and adultery; thus setting
at nought an institution established by Jehovah himself,
and designed to promote the happiness and virtue of
his creatures. It dooms its victims to ignorance, and consequently
to vice. &quot;I think I may safely assert,&quot; says
Mr. Moore, &quot;that ignorance is the inseparable companion
of slavery, and that the desire of freedom is the inevitable
consequence of implanting in the human mind any useful
degree of intelligence: it is therefore the policy of the
master that the ignorance of his slaves should be as profound
as possible; and such a state of ignorance is wholly
incompatible with the existence of any moral principles
or exalted feeling in the breast of the slave. (Speech of
Mr. Moore, House of Delegates, Va., 1832.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How horrible must be that system which demands as
the necessary condition of its existence, that knowledge
should be shut out from the minds of those who live under
it&mdash;that they should be reduced as nearly as possible to
the level of brutes, or living machines&mdash;that the powers of
their souls should be crushed! Let each one of us ask,
Can such a system be aided, or even tolerated, without
deep criminality?&quot; (Ad. to the Pres. of Ken. by a committee
of the synod of Kentucky.)</p>

<p class="indent">But even if slavery could be divested of all its horrible
accompaniments, its ignorance, licentiousness, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
nameless abominations, we should still regard the circumstance
of man holding his brother man as property as one
of the blackest crimes which corrupt human nature ever
invented. Mr. Moore, in the speech from which we have
already quoted, is compelled to acknowledge the iniquity
of this system. &quot;It cannot be denied,&quot; he says, &quot;as a
general principle, that it is an act of tyranny, injustice,
and oppression, to hold any part of the human race in
bondage against their consent.... The right to the enjoyment
of liberty is one of those perfect, inherent, and inalienable
rights which pertain to the whole human race,
and of which they can never be divested, except by an
act of gross injustice.&quot; If we would rightly estimate the
wretchedness in which the perpetration of this &quot;act of
gross injustice&quot; has involved one sixth part of the population
of Republican America, we must compare the condition
of our slaves with that of the freemen of their own
age and country. &quot;Things are estimated by comparison;
and the man who is deprived of every natural, civil, and
social right, while all around him are basking in the sunshine
of freedom, must feel the fangs of slavery much
more poignantly than the one who, though subjected to
similar privations, beholds his lot but little below that of
those who surround him.&quot; We must not, therefore, compare
the situation of slaves in the United States with that
of the slaves of heathen Greece and Rome, where equal
laws never existed, and where the beams of liberty and
Christianity never shone; but to form a correct judgment
of the miseries endured by our slaves, we must compare
them with the laboring class of our population in the free
states, and we may then comprehend the debasing influence
of a system which produces such dreadful results
as are exhibited on almost every Southern plantation,
where the lash is the principal, if not the only stimulus.</p>

<p class="indent">You are, dear friends, in a peculiar manner fellow-sufferers
with those who are in bondage; because the whites,
having reduced their colored brethren to slavery, with a
cruelty proportioned to their unjust usurpation of power,
have labored to impress on the mind of the community,
the unfounded calumny that the people of color are unfit
for freedom: this assertion is designed, on the part of
slaveholders, as a salve for their consciences, and a plea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
for the continuation of slavery, and is used by the adversary
of all good for the diabolical purpose of shielding
from merited infamy the system of American slavery.</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing will contribute more to break the bondman&#39;s
fetters, than an example of high moral worth, intellectual
culture and religious attainments among the free people of
color&mdash;living epistles known and read of all men&mdash;a standard
of exalted piety, of dedication to the works of righteousness,
of humble-mindedness, of Christian charity; to
which abolitionists may confidently point, and ask those
who are forging the manacles of hopeless servitude for
our countrymen, what they can answer to the Judge of all
the earth for thus robbing him of his immortal creatures;
and demand of them, in view of what their slaves might
be, to restore their victims to themselves, to the human
family, and to God.</p>

<p class="indent">We know, and we rejoice in the knowledge, that the
gift of intellect is co-extensive with the human race, and
that our brethren and sisters, who are writhing under the
lash of worse than Egyptian taskmasters&mdash;whose minds
are beclouded by ignorance and enfeebled by suffering,
need only to have the same advantages which Europeans
and their descendants have enjoyed, triumphantly to refute
the unfounded calumny that they are inferior in the powers
of intellect, and less susceptible of mental improvement.
We maintain, that the people of color are not in
any respect inferior to the white man, and that under favorable
circumstances they would rise again to the rank
they formerly held.</p>

<p class="indent">The everlasting architecture of Africa still exists&mdash;the
wonder of the world, though in ruins: her mighty kingdoms
have yet their record in history; she has poured
forth her heroes on the field, given bishops to the church,
and martyrs to the fires. And for African physiognomy,
as though that should shut out the light of intellect, go to
your national museum, contemplate the features of the
colossal head of Memnon, and the statues of the divinities
on which the ancient Africans impressed their own forms,
and there see, in close resemblance to their features, the
mould of those countenances which once beheld as the
creatures of their own immortal genius the noblest and
most stupendous monuments of human skill, and taste,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
and grandeur. In the imperishable porphyry and granite,
is the unfounded and pitiful slander publicly and before
all the world refuted: there we see the African under
<i>cultivation</i>. If he now presents a different aspect, cultivation
is wanting&mdash;that solves the whole case: for, even
now, where education has been expended upon the pure
and undoubted descendants of Africans, it has never been
bestowed in vain. Modern times have witnessed, in their
persons, Generals, Physicians, Philosophers, Linguists,
Poets, Mathematicians, and Merchants&mdash;all eminent in
their attainments, energetic in enterprise, and honorable
in character; and the Mission schools in the West Indies
exhibit a quickness of intellect, and a thirst for learning,
to which the schools of this country do not always afford
a parallel.&quot; (Sermon by Richard Watson, pp. 7, 8, Butterworth,
1824.)</p>

<p class="indent">Sacred history bears ample testimony to the learning
of the Egyptians. &quot;Solomon&#39;s wisdom excelled the
wisdom of all the children of the East country and all the
wisdom of Egypt.&quot; Even in our own country, under the
oppressive system which slavery and prejudice have
reared to crush the people of color, the superiority which
occasionally shines out, notwithstanding all the disabilities
by which we have surrounded them, proves beyond
dispute that they are the gifted children of our Heavenly
Father. In proof of this, we shall adduce from numerous
testimonies, that of F. A. Sayre, for nine years a teacher
of one of the public schools in Cincinnati.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Facts have been developed in the progress of the day
schools and Sunday schools here, which have made me
believe that the colored people are not only equal to white
people in natural capacity to be taught, but that they exceed
them: they do not receive instruction; they seize it
as a person who has long been famishing for food&mdash;seize
the smallest crumb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I several times visited the different schools for colored
children and have always been gratified to observe the
good order and attention to study which the pupils manifest,
and particularly with the affection with which they
regard their teachers. I have, however, known more particularly
the school for boys which brother W&mdash;&mdash;
teaches, there I have seen boys of from 9 to 12 years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
age, who had learned the alphabet within a year, who
were able to exhibit to advantage, in reading and spelling,
to write legibly, to recite long lessons in History, which
they had been a short time studying, and to undergo an
examination in Arithmetic, which when I first witnessed
it, perfectly astonished me. I have taught common
schools for about 15 years at intervals, and have visited
many taught by others, and I must candidly say, that I
have never been acquainted with one which for rapid progress
in the different studies pursued, and for the interests
manifested by the pupils could be compared with this, nor
have I ever seen so much good feeling in the intercourse
of teacher and pupils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And, in corroboration of the above position, we shall
mention a few out of many instances in which persons of
color have surmounted every obstacle to mental and moral
improvement. James Derham, who was originally a
slave, was skilled in the languages, and became the most
distinguished Physician at New Orleans. Dr. Rush, of
Philadelphia, says, &quot;I conversed with him, and found
him very learned: I thought I could give him information
concerning the treatment of diseases, but I learned more
from him than he could expect from me.&quot; Benjamin
Bannaker was a slave in Maryland: he obtained his freedom,
and removed to Philadelphia. Without any encouragement
but his passion for acquiring knowledge, and
with no other books than the works of Ferguson and the
tables of Tobias Mayer, he applied himself to the study
of Astronomy. In 1794 and &#39;95, he published Almanacs
at Philadelphia, in which are calculated and exhibited
the different aspects of the planets, a table of the motions
of the sun and moon, their risings and sittings, and the
courses of the bodies of the planetary system. Bannaker
sent his Almanac in manuscript to Thomas Jefferson,
previous to its publication, accompanied by a long and
interesting letter on the condition of his brethren; and
the following extracts are taken from Jefferson&#39;s reply:&mdash;&quot;Sir,
I thank you sincerely for your letter, and for the
Almanac it contained. Nobody wishes more than I do,
to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given
to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other
colors of men; and that the appearance of the want of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their
existence, both in Africa and America. I have taken the
liberty of sending your Almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet,
Secretary of the Academy of Sciences at Paris,
and Member of the Philanthropic Society, because I considered
it a document to which your whole color had a
right for their justification against the opinions which have
been entertained of them.&quot; A late West India paper
mentions the death of Mr. Watkis, a colored lawyer in
Jamaica, &quot;by which the bar was deprived of one of its
brightest ornaments.&quot; In the Island of St. Kitts, the proportion
of colored members is increasing every year, and
several of the special magistrates are colored men. The
Editor of the St. Christopher Weekly Intelligencer and
Advertiser is a colored man, who has been a bold advocate
of liberal principles. He is described as a thorn in
the side of the planters, and a great blessing to the
Island. And in the United States of America, there are
men and women now living whose talents, piety, and
worth, are undeniable.</p>

<p class="indent">If we contemplate the moral character of the colored
man we shall meet with even more frequent demonstrations
of the kind care of our beneficent Creator who hath
made of one blood all nations, and bestowed upon his rational
creatures those qualities of the heart which are the
brightest ornament of human nature. &quot;In maternal, filial
and fraternal affections,&quot; says Wadstrom, &quot;I scruple not to
pronounce them superior to any Europeans I was ever
among.&quot; &quot;Of all the people I have ever met I think they
are the kindest, they will let none of their people want
for victuals, they will lend and not look for it again, they
will even lend clothes to each other if they want to go
any where, if strangers come to them they will give them
victuals for nothing, they will go out of their beds that
strangers may sleep in them.&quot;&mdash;We not unfrequently have
the evidence of slaveholders themselves to the faithfulness
and tender attachment of their slaves. In a sermon
preached by George W. Freeman, Rector of Christ
Church, Raleigh, North Carolina, in which he endeavors
to prove that slavery is a Bible institution we find the following
testimony to the moral worth of those whom he
calls a different race of men.&quot; &quot;To <i>many</i> of our servants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
to <i>them</i> who serve us faithfully, who are ever attentive
to our wants, who cheerfully fulfil our commands, who labor
abroad for us when we are in health, and who come
at our call to nurse us in our sickness, and who, laying
aside, as it were, all regard to their own comforts, submit
without murmuring, or impatience to the most wearying
and exhausting of all employments, complying with our
most unreasonable whims, and meekly bearing with our
fretfulness and caprices; <i>to them</i>, and I must do this class
of people the justice to say there are <i>many such</i> among
us&mdash;<i>to such of our domestics as these we surely owe a debt
of gratitude, which all our kindliest acts, should we even live
beyond the age of man would scarce suffice to discharge</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Noble instances are recorded of their self-denial and
liberality.&mdash;&quot;Jasmin Thoumazeau was born in Africa,
brought to St. Domingo and sold for a slave when he was
22 years of age, but afterwards obtaining his freedom
he established a Hospital at the Cape, in 1756 for poor
persons of color. More than forty years were devoted
by himself and his wife to this benevolent institution,
and his fortune was subservient to their wants. The only
regret they felt, while their time and substance was devoted
to these destitute objects, arose from a fear that after
they were gone the Hospital might be abandoned.&quot; Joseph
Rachel, a trader, who resided in the island of Barbadoes
went to a man who had lost his property and to
whom in the early part of his life he owed some obligations
and gave him the fragment of his burnt bond for
£60 and his discharged account for a considerable sum,
telling him he was sensibly affected with his misfortunes
and releasing him from all obligation to pay the debts.
The philanthropists of England take pleasure in speaking
of him. Having become rich by commerce, he consecrated
all his fortune to acts of benevolence. The unfortunate
without <span class="smcap">DISTINCTION OF COLOR</span> had a claim on
his affections. He gave to the indigent, lent to those
who could not make a return&mdash;visited prisoners, gave
them good advice and endeavored to bring back the guilty
to virtue.&quot; Two slaves in New Orleans who by industry
and economy had purchased their freedom and laid up
about $400, bought with their earnings the freedom of
another slave.&mdash;One day as the wife was sitting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
door of her cottage she said to herself &quot;I have so much
money and if I can make it the instrument of redeeming
one of my fellow-beings from slavery, then I can say to
my soul &#39;depart in peace.&#39; She accordingly purchased
one for $250 and in order to place her in a situation
where she would hear the gospel preached, she brought
her to the city of New-York. A more noble instance of
genuine benevolence does not adorn the annals of philanthropy
than is exhibited in this illiterate daughter of
Africa, who gave nearly her all to redeem one captive
sister. We have in this city a colored sister well
known and beloved who by the labor of her own hands
has ransomed eleven slaves.&mdash;But for her they would
probably have dragged out their lives in hopeless bondage.&mdash;Her
&quot;witness is in heaven, her record is on
high.
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Similar accounts might be multiplied but enough
has been said to prove to any candid mind the truth of
our position, we will therefore only add the testimony of
some of our Southern sisters who affirm that they have
known slaves of exalted piety, high intelligence and warm
affections, who under circumstances the most trying have
exhibited a degree of practical Christianity they have
rarely witnessed.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
 In citing these instances of benevolence we wish it understood, that
while we approve of <i>redeeming</i> a captive from bondage, we utterly deny
the <i>right</i> of the master to <i>sell</i> or <i>hold</i> the slave as property, just as we
deny the right of the Corsair to the persons of his prisoners, or the ransom
which may be offered for their redemption.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">We cannot forbear mentioning in connection with this
subject the noble example which the colored slaveholders
of Martinique have set to their white brethren by petitioning
the French Chamber of Deputies to abolish slavery
in that island, stating that they regarded it as an act not
only of justice but of policy.&mdash;This is the only record on
the page of history of such an act of mercy but we hope
it may stimulate slaveholders in these United States to
petition Congress to exert her influence in destroying the
horrible system of American Slavery by abolishing it in
the District of Columbia and in Florida, and by exterminating
the interstate slave trade.</p>

<p class="indent">We earnestly entreat you to emulate the conduct of
your brethren in Martinique by letting your righteousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
exceed the righteousness of our white fellow-citizens.
&quot;That whereas they speak evil against you as evil doers,
they may by your good works which they shall behold
glorify God. For so is the will of God that with well
doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish
men.&quot; Your situation is in some respects more favorable
to the growth of piety than that of the whites, you are in
the furnace of affliction, and adversity has a much more
salutary influence on the mind than prosperity. We believe
that our Almighty Father has permitted your unparallelled
sufferings, because he designs to bring you up to
his assistance in regenerating our guilty country&mdash;he has
been at infinite pains to refine you as silver is refined, that
you may reflect more perfectly in your conduct and conversation
the image of Jesus Christ. &quot;Beloved think it
not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as
though some strange thing happened unto you, but rejoice
in as much as ye are partakers of Christ&#39;s sufferings.&quot;
You have the advantage of standing aloof from the political
chicanery and wickedness which seem inseparable
from public life, you are shielded from many of those
temptations which encircle the fashionable world, and in
a measure from the love of money, which is the root of
all evil, because the acquisition of wealth is not with you
as with your paler brethren, the certain means of worldly
distinction. You may examine with a philosophic and
impartial eye, the baneful effect of all these influences upon
our white population, and as you rise from under the
unhallowed prejudice which now crushes you to the earth,
remember the solemn responsibilities which rest upon you
and keep yourselves unspotted from the world, that your
praise may be of God and not of men.</p>

<p class="indent">With deep regret we have heard that some of our colored
brethren and sisters in our great cities frequent the theatre.
This is a sink of vice from which we earnestly
beseech you to keep yourselves entirely separate. Let
the language of every one amongst you be, &quot;Oh my soul,
come not thou into their secret, unto their assembly mine
honor, be not thou united.&quot; Sometimes in these scenic
representations, your &quot;countrymen in chains&quot; are held up
to the scorn and derision of an unfeeling multitude; the
poor slave is introduced to be the object of heartless mirth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
Can any colored man or woman voluntarily witness these
dreadful pictures of the degradation of their brethren, and
does not your presence identify you with the oppressors,
who thus wantonly hold up to public contempt those whom
they have first debased, and then despised.</p>

<p class="indent">Permit us to offer you a few remarks on the subject of
personal decoration&mdash;this is a snare which Satan still triumphantly
lays, even for professing Christians who indulge
in fashionable and extravagant apparel, forgetful of the
apostolic injunction, &quot;Let your adorning not be that outward
adorning, of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold,
or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man
of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament
of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price.&quot; Our hearts have been comforted
in our intercourse with you, by observing that there is
little gaudy or superfluous dress to be seen, in such places
of worship as we have visited; we regard it as one
evidence of the purity of your morals, and your just sense
of that decorum which ought to characterise every Christian
assembly. A Christian legislator has said that the
trappings of the vain world would clothe the naked,
and we affectionately entreat you to cultivate such a
sense of your accountability to God, and the allegiance
you owe to Him, that your dress may be such as becomes
men and women professing godliness. To you this branch
of religious duty is of double importance. A large proportion
of you are obliged to obtain a subsistence by your
daily labor; some of you are filling the responsible office
of teachers, and it is of great consequence that you expend
in the most judicious and profitable manner what is
thus hardly earned, and that you set an example of Christian
moderation and simplicity to your companions and
your pupils.</p>

<p class="indent">Another reason for the practice of Christian economy
in all your expenditures, is, that extravagance either in
living or in apparel, has a deleterious influence on the
poorer classes of our community, both colored and white;
it draws a line of division between the rich and the poor,
which is destructive of that equality, that sweet fellowship
of feeling, which God designed should exist among
his creatures; it creates factitious distinctions in society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
which are utterly at variance with the law of love that
Christ gave as a governing principle to his disciples.
When he designed to do us good, he took upon himself
the form of a servant&mdash;surely we should love and honor
this office. He took his station at the bottom of society, He
voluntarily identified himself with the poor and the despised,
He manifested a peculiar interest in those classes
which we are wont to treat as our inferiors, because He
designed to elevate them, to give a moral impulse to their
character, and to make them new creatures. He wanted
them to behold in Him a model to imitate, as well as to
give them the unspeakable advantage of mingling with Him
in near and intimate communion. This was no doubt a
powerful incentive to them to emulate their divine friend,
and render themselves worthy companions of the Lord
Jesus. None of us can stoop as low as our Saviour did,
because the same infinite distance cannot exist between
created beings; but we may as far as our frailty admits,
imitate His blessed example; we may like Him, make ourselves
of no reputation; we may, like Him, sit down at
the table of the despised publican and sinner, and cheer
the abodes of the humble and the poor by our presence
and our love. This interchange of social visits, this meeting
together as suppliants at a throne of grace, will form
a bond of union stronger than any that can exist, while
the rich and the educated stand at a distance from the
poor, and invite them to come up, without advancing near
enough to stretch forth the hand to assist their efforts.
Our minds are solemnly impressed with the necessity of
practising this duty, both among the colored and white
population, and it would gladden our hearts to see you taking
the lead in this Christ-like enterprise. We are persuaded
that if we would labor effectually for the moral
and intellectual elevation of the poor, we must condescend
to men of low estate; we must identify ourselves
with them, and place ourselves on their level; we must,
by our example as well as our precepts, teach them that
moral worth is our standard of excellence, and that we
are living in the practical acknowledgement of that sublime
precept &quot;One is your master, even Christ, and all ye
are brethren.&quot; Whilst we press this duty upon our colored
brethren and sisters, we feel that it is equally incumbent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
upon all, and desire through divine assistance to be
strengthened to perform it.</p>

<p class="indent">We wish also to suggest the importance of cultivating the
virtue of personal and domestic neatness; we believe it contributes
essentially to the purity of the heart, and that attention
to the neatness of our persons, and the order of our
habitations, has a happy influence on the temper and the
understanding, as well as the morals. We are aware that
it is often difficult, where necessity compels us to use one
apartment for every purpose, to preserve that order and
cleanliness which is desirable, but we believe where the
wish prevails, much may be accomplished, even in very unfavorable
circumstances. Many of you sustain the relations
of servants in families; this places you in a very responsible
situation, because it brings you under the daily
observation of those, who have been educated with deep-rooted
prejudices against you, and it affords the best opportunity
of proving that these prejudices are as unfounded,
as they are unjust&mdash;of exhibiting in your deportment,
that moral loveliness which will constrain those who regard
themselves as your superiors, to acknowledge that
worth can neither be determined by the color of the
skin, nor by the station occupied. You have it in your
power, by a faithful and conscientious discharge of your
duties, to secure the highest wages for your services, and
by a prudent and economical use of those wages, to obtain
for your children, if not for yourselves, the blessing
of a good education, but we affectionately exhort you not
to enter into any engagements as domestics, which will
deprive you of the privilege of reading the Scriptures, and
attending a place of worship, this being a duty which is
imperatively called for as an evidence of our allegiance
to the King of kings. Carefully avoid families which
pay little or no respect to the Sabbath, that you may
escape the contamination arising from such intercourse.
We have regretted seeing so many of our colored
friends engaged as servants in hotels and steam-boats;
these places are not calculated to cherish moral and religious
feeling, and they afford few facilities for the cultivation
of the mind. Agricultural pursuits would contribute
more to independence and elevation of character, and
however much we may be disposed to aid you, it will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
after all by your own exertions that you will rise to that
situation in society, which we desire to see you occupy.</p>

<p class="indent">The establishment of good schools is another very important
means of aiding in the great work of moral and intellectual
elevation; to promote this object every exertion should
be made. On the rising generation depends in a great measure
the success of that enterprise, which aims at establishing
Christian and Republican equality among the citizens
of these United States. Let us then labor to implant in
the minds of our children a love for useful learning, to imbue
them thoroughly with religious feeling, to train them to habits
of thinking, of industry and economy, to lead them to the
contemplation of noble and benevolent objects, that they
may regard themselves as responsible beings upon whom
high and holy duties devolve. Let them come up to the
help of the Lord in the mighty work in which we are engaged,
prepared by education and enlightened piety to aid
in the great moral conflict between light and darkness,
which now agitates our guilty country. Anti-Slavery Societies,
embracing in their Constitutions, abstinence from
slave labor products, as far as this can be done. Peace Societies,
based on the principle that all war is inconsistent with
the gospel. Temperance Societies, on the principle of abstinence
from all that can intoxicate, and Moral Reform Societies
should be organized throughout our land wherever
it is practicable. The formation of Maternal Associations,
Dorcas Societies, Reading &amp; Conversation Companies, and
above all, Meetings for Prayer will have a salutary influence
in combining efforts for improvement. Whenever you can
unite with white associations, it will be productive of reciprocal
benefit, because it will tend to remove that unchristian
prejudice which &quot;bites like a serpent, and stings like an
adder.&quot; You may have to suffer much in thus commingling,
but we entreat you to bear hardness as good soldiers of Jesus
Christ, that your children, and your children&#39;s children, may
be spared the anguish you are compelled to endure on this
account. To carry forward these various schemes of elevation
and improvement, money is absolutely requisite,
and if all that is saved from unnecessary expenses be lent
to the Lord to advance the great work of Reformation, as
well as devoted to charitable purposes it will be treasure
laid up in heaven, which neither moth nor rust can corrupt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
Another subject which is worthy of your consideration
is the consistency of abstaining, as Abolitionists, from the
use of slave labor products, as far as is practicable. The
conviction that this is a duty, is gaining ground among the
friends of emancipation, and we doubt not that the self-denial
which it will probably demand on our part, will
arouse the conscience of the slaveholder, by demonstrating
that we are willing to sacrifice interest and convenience
to principle. To the toil-worn slave, it will minister
unspeakable consolation, to hear, while bending over
the rice, or sugar, or cotton field, and writhing under the
lash, that his friends at the North feel a sympathy so deep
for his sufferings, that they cannot partake of the proceeds of
his unrequited toil. Think you not it would cheer his agonized
heart, and impart renewed strength to endure his affliction,
to know that his blood was not spilt for the gratification
of those who are trying to obtain for him the blessing
of liberty. We entreat you to give this evidence of your
love to those who have emphatically fallen among thieves,
then, although you cannot pour the wine and the oil into their
corporeal wounds, nor dress with mollifying ointment, the
bloody gash of the drivers&#39; whip, you may minister to their
mental comfort, and soothe their broken hearts. Let it
not be imagined that the slaves of the South are destitute
of intelligence, or ignorant of what is doing at the North;
many a noble mind is writhing there in bondage, and panting
for deliverance, as the hart panteth after the water
brooks. Mr. Goode, in the legislature of Virginia in 1832,
when he brought in the resolution which produced the celebrated
debate in that body, &quot;earnestly pressed upon the
House, the effect of what was passing upon the minds
of the slaves themselves. Many of them he represented
as wise and intelligent men, constantly engaged in reflection,
informed of all that was occurring, and having
their attention fixed upon the Legislature.&quot; And we have
been informed on good authority, that a slave in one of
the Southern states, one of those whose soul never bowed
to the yoke of bondage, said, that himself and his fellow
sufferers spent many a midnight hour in discussing the
probable results of the abolition movements, and were firmly
persuaded that their redemption from bondage would
finally be effected, though they knew not exactly by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
what means it would be accomplished. Every fugitive
slave who is carried back, bears to his unhappy countrymen
an account of all that is doing. Every freeman who
falls into the ruthless fangs of the kidnapper, spreads information
at the South, of all our efforts for the abolition of
slavery, and we put it to any one of ourselves, whether, if
we were wasting our energies, and toiling in cheerless bondage,
it would not be some alleviation to know, that there
were those who loved us so tenderly, and felt for us so
keenly, that they would not participate in the luxuries
which were the fruit of our extorted and unrequited labor.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been urged, and with some plausibility, that the
use of the products of slave labor, is one of the &quot;little
things&quot; connected with the great cause of abolition. Admitting
it to be little, is it therefore unimportant? Does
not the reproof of our Redeemer exactly apply to this case,
when in speaking of the tithe of mint, annise and cummin,
and the weightier matters of the law, he says, &quot;This ought
ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone;&quot; but
however small it may appear, it involves a great principle,
because it really encourages the traffic in human flesh,
by offering to the slaveholder an inducement to perpetuate
the system of oppression from which he derives his unrighteous
gains. Another hackneyed objection is, that our abstaining
will not lessen the quantity grown, and other consumers
will soon be found. With this we have nothing to
do; we might on the same premises, purchase and hold
slaves, because if we do not, others will. No doubt much
inconvenience and some privation must be endured, but
this will be continually decreasing, as West India productions
will furnish a substitute. In some instances the
use of cotton cannot perhaps be avoided by the poor, but
still much may be done, and those of us who have made
the experiment can testify that our abstinence has strengthened
us for the work we are engaged in, and that there is
a sweet feeling of conscious integrity that gladdens our
hearts. &quot;I will wash mine hands in innocency, so will
I compass thine altar, oh Lord.&quot; In proportion as the demand
for free labor products increases, the supply will
increase, and the greater the quantity of such articles
which is thrown into the market, the more their price will
lessen. Besides &quot;allowing the labor of a slave for six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
years, to produce all the various slave-grown products
which anyone may use during the course of his life, would
not he who was so occupied be in effect the slave of such an
one during the time he was thus employed?&quot; This is a
solemn and affecting consideration, and can be most correctly
weighed when we are on our knees before God; it
is a matter between Him and every individual soul, and
he alone can settle it.</p>

<p class="indent">We believe it was the want of that principle which
we have been endeavoring to inculcate, &quot;Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself,&quot; that gave birth to the
scheme of expatriating our colored brethren to Africa.
We do not design to attribute unhallowed motives to all
who engaged in this crusade against the rights and happiness
of free American citizens; many, we believe, like
our beloved brother, Gerrit Smith, embarked in this enterprise
without examining the principles of the Society,
deluded by the false, though plausible assertion, that the colored
man could not rise in his native land to an equality
with his white compatriots, and desirous to do them all the
good that circumstances admitted. Nevertheless, we are
constrained to believe what you have so often asserted,
and so keenly felt, that &quot;The Colonization Society originated
in hatred to the free people of color.&quot; We rejoice
that you early detected the fallacy and the iniquity of this
scheme; that you arose in the dignity of conscious rights,
in the majesty of moral power, in the boldness of injured
innocence, and exposed the cruelty and unrighteousness
of a project, which, had it been carried fully into execution,
would have robbed America of some of her best and
most valuable citizens, and exiled from our shores, those
whose hearts are bound to their country by no common
bonds, even by the holy bonds of sympathy for their
&quot;countrymen in chains.&quot; A project which would have
poured upon the shores of Pagan Africa, a broken hearted
population, prepared by mental suffering to sink into a premature
grave. A band of exiles, who had been exposed
against their judgment and their will, to all the nameless
trials which belong to the settlement of colonial establishments,
and all that anguish which must have been endured
under the reflection that they had been banished from the
land of their birth, merely to gratify an unhallowed prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
when their country needed their services, when there was
abundant room in the land, though not in the hearts of their
countrymen. We admire your noble and uncompromising
resistance to this scheme of oppression, and your children
will thank you to the latest generation. We honor you
for the undaunted and generous resolutions which you
passed soon after the Colonization Society came into existence,
when the spontaneous language of your hearts
was embodied in the following sentiments:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whereas, our ancestors (not of choice) were the first
successful cultivators of the wilds of America, we their
descendants, feel ourselves entitled to participate in the
blessings of her luxuriant soil, which their blood and sweat
manured, and that any measure, or system of measures,
having a tendency to banish us from her bosom, would not
only be cruel, but would be in direct violation of those
principles which have been the boast of this republic.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Resolved</i>, That we view with deep abhorrence the unmerited
stigma attempted to be cast upon the reputation of
the free people of color, by the promoters of this measure,
&quot;that they are a dangerous and useless part of the community.&quot;
When in the state of disfranchisement in which they
live, in the hour of danger they ceased to remember their
wrongs, and rallied round the standard of their country.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Resolved</i>, That we will never separate ourselves from
the slave population in this country: they are our brethren
by the ties of consanguinity, of suffering, and of wrong;
and we feel that there is more virtue in suffering privations
with them, than enjoying fancied advantages for
a season.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Resolved</i>, That having the strongest confidence in the
justice of God, and in the philanthropy of the free states,
we cheerfully submit our destinies to the guidance of Him
who suffers not a sparrow to fall to the ground without
his special Providence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We praise the Lord, that while the white man slumbered
over the wrongs of his enslaved countrymen, or
stretched out his hands to rivet the bondman&#39;s chains, or
to thrust his brother from his side, your sympathy and
your compassion, like that of the beneficent Redeemer,
was wakeful and active, and called forth from the depths
of your souls the following soul-stirring appeal. Where,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
oh! where were the hearts of Americans, that they
responded not to your call?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We <i>humbly</i>, respectfully, and fervently entreat and
beseech your disapprobation of the plan of colonization
now offered by the &quot;American Society for Colonizing the
Free People of Color of the United States.&quot; Here, in
the city of Philadelphia, where the voice of the suffering
sons of Africa was first heard&mdash;where was first commenced
the work of abolition on which heaven has smiled
(for it could have success only from the great Master); let
not a purpose be assisted which will stay the cause of the
entire abolition of slavery in the United States, and which
may defeat it altogether&mdash;which proffers to those who do
not ask for them what it calls <i>benefits</i>, but which they
consider <i>injuries</i>&mdash;and which must ensure to the multitude,
whose prayers can only reach you through us, <i>misery</i>,
<i>sufferings</i>, and <i>perpetual slavery</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor can we pass by unnoticed the noble conduct of our
sister in Ohio, who, when her father proposed to bring
her to the North, where she might pass for a white woman,
and settle upon her a comfortable independence, replied
that she would never forsake her people&mdash;that she
would rather suffer with them than enjoy all the advantages
he promised. We do homage to the virtue which
preferred to endure affliction with the oppressed, rather
than to bask in the sunshine of worldly prosperity and
popular favor.</p>

<p class="indent">But for the dignified opposition which you manifested&mdash;but
for the developments which you made of the real
designs and fearful consequences of colonization, your
guilty country would probably have added to her manifold
transgressions against the descendants of Africa, the transcendant
crime of banishing from her shores those whom
she has deeply injured, and whom she is bound by every
law of justice and of mercy to cherish with peculiar tenderness.
But for your virtuous and uncompromising hostility
to the Colonization Society, a portion of our countrymen
might never have been disabused of the idle and
fallacious expectation, that this scheme would cure the
moral evil of slavery, and put an end to the horrible slave
traffic carried on on the coast of Africa. You saw that
the root of the evil was in our own land, and that the expatriation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
of the best part of our colored population, so far
from abolishing slavery, would render the condition of the
enslaved tenfold more hopeless. You saw that the only
means of destroying the slave trade, was to destroy the
spirit of slavery; and how just have been your conclusions,
let the following testimonies declare&mdash;we extract
from an official communication to the secretary of the
Navy, by Captain Joseph J. Nicholson of the Navy:&mdash;&quot;The
slave trade, within the last three years, has seriously
injured the colony. Not only has it diverted the industry
of the natives, but it has effectually cut off the communication
with the interior. The war parties being in the
habit of plundering and kidnapping for slaves all whom
they meet, whether parties to the war or not, the daring
of the slaver increases with the demand for slaves, which
could not of late be supplied by the usual means; and
within a year four slave factories have been established
almost within sight of the Colony.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The following statement is taken from the &quot;Colored
American:&quot;&mdash;A vessel arrived at Halifax on the 12th ult.,
from Kingston, Jamaica, which reports, that when two days
out she fell in with a Spanish slaver bound to Havana,
having four hundred poor wretched beings on board, in a
state of starvation. Forty had died for want of food.
The captain stated that the poor creatures had, during the
past month, subsisted on rice water.&quot; Had we not been
blinded by interest and by prejudice, our reason might
have taught us that as long as the republic of the U. S.
is a mart where human flesh and souls of men are bought
and sold, so long will European and American cupidity
furnish human merchandise for this detestable commerce.
Thousands of slaves have been introduced into the United
States through the island of Cuba, since the slave trade
was declared piracy by our national legislature. We
stand before the world as a nation of hypocrites, and you
are equally concerned, as American citizens, to labor to
bring your country to a sense of her crimes. You are
equally concerned to do all that can be done, to arrest the
progress of the spirit of colonization, which takes our
countrymen from their native land without their consent, by
giving them the cruel alternative of slavery or banishment,
breaks up the tenderest ties of nature and casts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
them on a foreign soil. And what is our international
slave trade, but compulsory colonization. &quot;There have
been transported&mdash;doubtless without their consent&mdash;from
the older slave states to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Arkansas, during the year 1836, the enormous number
of two hundred and fifty thousand slaves.&quot;&mdash;<i>Eman.</i></p>

<p class="indent">We deeply deplore the situation of our free colored
citizens in the slaveholding states, we sympathize in their
trials, we know that the oppressive laws enacted against
them are to use the language of a writer in the Richmond
Whig of March 21, 1832, &quot;A code of penal laws
in many respects worthy the temper of Draco, written
indeed in blood.... By this code information to them
is proscribed, social intercourse interdicted, religious worship
in most of its forms prohibited.&quot; We know that
these unrighteous decrees have driven many of our Southern
brethren to a foreign land in the hope of finding on
the shores of heathen Africa, a degree of liberty, independence
and happiness which they saw no human probability
of enjoying in Christian America, but while we
sympathize with them in their sufferings, of which the
free people of color in the non-slaveholding States largely
participate, yet we believe that patient submission to these
cruel inflictions, would have identified their interests
more with that portion of our countrymen who are toiling
in bonds, and would have advanced the cause of emancipation.
The cruel policy of the slaveholder to separate
as much as possible the free people of color from the
slaves, to prevent all coalition between them, to destroy
all sympathy of feeling and oneness of interest, has
succeeded but too well&mdash;the free colored people of the
South stand by themselves, unacknowledged as men by
their haughty superiors, unknown as brethren by their
down-trodden &quot;countrymen in chains,&quot; a few of them
have even been tempted to join hands with the oppressor
and rivet bonds on those for whose deliverance they should
have toiled and wept and prayed. One of the results of
this crafty policy has been, that many have been seduced
to abandon their country and their enslaved brethren, to
seek for themselves and their families an asylum from the
<i>oppression</i> of Christian, Republican, America. These,
however unintentionally, have, we believe, fully answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
the designs of the subtle politicians of the South and have
bound more firmly around the quivering limbs of their
kindred the manacles of slavery.&mdash;The desertion of such
has added strength to the Colonization interest, and cherished
the insane hope that all our valuable free colored
citizens might in time be transported to Africa. We,
therefore, deprecate the departure of every free colored
American, <i>unless impelled by a sense of duty</i>, because it
is injurious to the interests of the slave and contributes
to foster in the bosoms of their white fellow-citizens that
prejudice which Satan created and which he is now using
as one of the most powerful engines to prevent the elevation
of the free and the enfranchisement of the enslaved.</p>

<p class="indent">Our brethren and sisters in bondage have their eyes
fixed with the deepest intensity of interest upon their
friends in the Northern States, they are looking unto us
as unto &quot;Saviours who shall come up on Mount Zion&quot; to
deliver them out of the hand of the spoiler. Jehovah has
entrusted us with a high and holy commission he has
commanded us to &quot;Defend the poor and fatherless, to do
justice to the afflicted and needy, to deliver the poor and
needy; to rid them out of the hand of the wicked&quot; and we
believe God will bless our efforts in this righteous cause,
if we are willing to endure the reproach, the calumny,
the self-denial which is involved in this Reformation, but
beloved friends let us keep ever in mind, that unless we
are men and women of prayer, we shall not be able to
effect what we profess so earnestly to desire, viz., that
God would melt the hearts of the slaveholders thro&#39; the
powerful influence of his Holy Spirit that they may &quot;let
their captives go,&quot; &quot;not for price nor reward,&quot; but for their
own peace sake and because the love of God is shed
abroad in their hearts. When the Redeemer of men was
about to ascend to the bosom of the Father and resume
the glory which he had with Him before the world was,
he promised his disciples that the power of the Holy
Ghost should come upon them, and that they should be
witnesses for Him to the uttermost parts of the earth.
What was the effect upon their minds?&quot; &quot;They all continued
with one accord in prayer and supplication with
the women.&quot; Stimulated by the confident expectation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
that Jesus would fulfil his gracious promise, they poured
out their hearts in fervent supplications, probably for
strength to do the work which he had appointed them
unto, for they felt that without Him they could do nothing
and they consecrated themselves on the altar of God, to
the great and glorious enterprize of preaching the unsearchable
riches of Christ to a lost and perishing world.
Have we less precious promises in the Scriptures of
Truth, may we not claim of our God the blessing promised
unto those who consider the poor, the Lord will preserve
them and keep them alive and they shall be blessed
upon the earth. Does not the language &quot;Inasmuch as
ye did it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye
did it unto me,&quot; belong to all who are rightly engaged in
endeavoring to unloose the bondman&#39;s fetters? Shall we
not then do as the Apostles did, shall we not in view of
the two millions of heathen in our very midst, in view of
the souls that are going down in an almost unbroken phalanx
to utter perdition, continue in prayer and supplication
that God will grant us the supplies of his Spirit to
prepare us for that work which he has given us to do.
Shall not the wail of the mother as she surrenders her
only child to the grasp of the ruthless kidnapper, or the
trader in human blood, animate our devotions. Shall not
the manifold crimes and horrors of slavery excite more
ardent outpourings at the throne of grace to grant repentance
to our guilty country and permit us to aid in preparing
the way for the glorious second Advent of the
Messiah, by preaching deliverance to the captives and the
opening of the prison doors to those who are bound.</p>

<p class="indent">But not alone for the down-trodden slave should we be
engaged to labor, our country from Maine to Florida is
more or less connected with, and involved in, the awful
sin of slavery, &quot;the blood of the poor innocents is found
in our skirts,&quot; the free states are partakers with those
who rob God of his creatures, for although most of them
have nominally no slaves on their soil, they do deliver
unto slaveholders the servant that is escaped from his
master, in direct violation of the command of Jehovah
&quot;Hide the outcasts: bewray not him that wandereth.&mdash;Let
mine outcasts dwell with thee; be thou a covert to
them from the face of the spoiler.&quot;&mdash;The unhappy fugitive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
goaded almost to madness by oppression finds no resting
place for the sole of his foot until he reaches the icy
shores of Canada. An exile from his native land, because
his soul cannot bow down to the unbridled passions
of his fellow-worm; because he nobly dares to take the
freedom which Jehovah gave him with the first inspiration
of his vital breath, because rather than be a slave he
braves the storm and plunges through the flood and suffers
hunger and thirst and nakedness and cold. For thus
magnanimously recoiling from unjust usurpation he is
branded as a fugitive, and hunted through our free states
with all the fierceness of savage barbarity, while no measures
are adopted to procure the repeal of these unrighteous
decrees. Oh when in this proud republic God maketh
inquisition for blood, when he remembereth the cry
of the humble&mdash;where shall we appear? will not the language
be uttered against us &quot;the land is full of blood;
the iniquity is exceeding great, mine eye shall not spare,
neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way
upon their head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is the church less corrupt than the state, she exhibits
now just such a departure from primitive purity as
is described by the prophet Ezekiel in speaking of the
Jewish Church.&mdash;&quot;Thou didst trust in thine own beauty,
because of thy renown. Thou hast also taken thy fair
jewels of my gold and my silver which I had given thee,
and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit
whoredom with them. And tookest thy broidered garments
and covered them, and thou hast set mine oil and
mine incense before them.&quot; Is it not the fear and the
<i>idolatry of man</i> which makes so many of those who fill
the sacred office of ministers of Jesus Christ stand dumb
on the watch-tower; so many unclose their sacrilegious
lips to stigmatize the God of Love as the founder of the
system of American slavery&mdash;what but the deep corruption
of the church could tempt her to cast over this bloody
moloch her broidered garment, and try by snatching a few
jewels to adorn her diadem from Ceylon and the Sandwich
Islands, from Burmah, and from the Rocky Mountains,
to turn away the public gaze from the leprosy which
consumes her vitals.</p>

<p class="indent">Let us not be deceived by the seeming prosperity of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
country. Babylon was filled with gold and with silver,
and Belshazzars impious feast was crowned with wine and
luxurious delicacies, yet even then the hand-writing on
the wall was appointed, the doom of that great empire
was decided in the court of heaven, and the irreversible
sentence was soon pronounced upon her haughty monarch,
&quot;Thou hast lifted up thyself, God hath numbered thy
kingdom and finished it.&quot; Let us not be deceived by the
fair appearances of the church, her efforts, and her revivals.
Slavery is the master sin of our country; it is
twined around the horns of the altar&mdash;it is couched beneath
the table on which are laid the sacramental elements&mdash;it
rises rampant in our pulpits&mdash;its spirit may be seen
stalking with unblushing effrontery through almost every
temple of benevolence, every seminary of learning,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
every Church of God where the white and the colored
are as carefully separated as though the one was washed
and made white in the blood of the Lamb, and the other
was an unclean thing, whose very touch was contamination.
We feel constrained to enter our solemn protest
against this unrighteous practice in all its forms.&mdash;&quot;God
has created of ONE BLOOD all the nations to
dwell on all the face of the earth,&quot; and whoever interposes
a barrier to their living as brethren, breaks the harmony
which He has established. Let the Church in America
deck herself as she may with the Lord&#39;s jewels,
so long as she cherishes the Hydra-headed monster
slavery in her bosom, so long will her oblations on heathen
shores be vain, her incense an abomination, her
solemn meetings a mockery. Our souls are drawn out in
tender sympathy to our dear brothers and sisters who are
the victims of this cruel prejudice, may you experience
that peace which the world can neither give nor take
away, and rejoice in the promise that the last shall be
first.</p>

 We mention as an example worthy of imitation the noble individuals
who took the lead at Lane Seminary in contending for the rights
of our colored citizens, and when their work there was accomplished,
went among their colored brethren and sisters, and met them as equals
bearing the impress of that God who stampt his image on his creature
man. If each of our seminaries could boast of such champions of Human
Rights, our colleges and schools might soon be regenerated, and
our temples of science be thrown open to all our citizens irrespective
of color or condition.</p>

Let us turn our eyes on God&#39;s chosen people and learn
a lesson fraught with fearful instruction.&mdash;As the time of
their downfall approached, when for their manifold transgressions
they were to be blotted out for a season, as
a nation, God multiplied the number of his witnesses
among them. Most of the prophets whose writings have
come down to us, lived either a short time before, or were
cotemporary with the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar;
the warning voices of Jeremiah and Ezekiel were
raised at this juncture, to save if possible their guilty
nation&mdash;with the women as well as the men they expostulated,
and admonished them of impending judgments,
but the people scornfully replied to Jeremiah&mdash;&quot;As for
the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the
Lord, we will not hearken unto thee, but we will certainly
do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our mouth.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, thus saith the Lord&mdash;ye have not hearkened
unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother,
and every one to his neighbor&mdash;behold I proclaim a liberty
for you saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence and
to the famine.&quot; Are we not virtually as a nation adopting
the same impious language, and are we not exposed to
the same tremendous judgments? Shall we not in view
of those things use every laudable means to awaken our
beloved country from the slumbers of death, and baptize
all our efforts with tears and with prayers, that God may
bless them. Then should our labor fail to accomplish the
end for which we pray; we shall stand acquitted at the
bar of Jehovah, and although we may share in the national
calamities which await unrepented sins, yet that blessed
approval will be ours.&mdash;&quot;Well done good and faithful servants,
enter ye into the joy of your Lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">We are aware that few of our colored brethren and
sisters are actively, or directly promoting the continuation
of slavery; we mourn indeed that a single instance can
be adduced, of one colored person betraying another into
the fangs of those merciless wretches who go about seeking
whom they may devour; we mourn, not because the
act is more diabolical on account of the complexion, but
because our enemies seize every such instance of moral
delinquency, to prove that the people of color are lost to
the feelings of humanity for each other.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Our hearts have been filled with sorrow at the transactions
which have lately disgraced the city of New York;
the forcible seizure and consigning to cruel bondage
native American citizens. In the emporium of our commerce,
in a city filled with Bibles and with churches, we
behold the revolting spectacle of rational and immortal
beings, arraigned before their fellow men, not for any
crimes which they have committed, but because they dare
to call their vital breath their own, and to take possession
of that body, soul, and mind, which their Creator gave
them. We behold them manacled and guarded by officers
armed with weapons of death&mdash;guiltless of crime and
accused of none, but forced to prove that they are men
and not beasts. We marvel, as we behold these reproachful
scenes, that the God of Justice has held back his
avenging sword.&mdash;&quot;Thus saith the Lord&mdash;execute judgment
in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out
of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire
that none can quench it, because of the evil of your
doings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But although we believe that the accumulated wrongs of
our colored friends are had in remembrance before God,
and that he will assuredly visit this nation in judgment
unless she repent, yet we entreat you in the name of the
Lord Jesus, to forbear any attempts violently to rescue
your brethren. Such attempts can only end in disappointment;
they infuriate public sentiment still more against
you, and furnish your blood-thirsty adversaries with a
plausible pretext, to treat you with cruelty. They bring
upon all your brethren unmerited odium, and render doubly
difficult the duties of those who have been called by
Jehovah to assert the colored man&#39;s right to freedom, and
to vindicate his character from those calumnies which have
been heaped upon him. Independent, however, of all
these reasons, we beseech you to possess your souls in
patience, because present duty is unresisting submission,
in accordance with the apostolic precepts.&mdash;&quot;Be subject
not only for wrath, but for conscience sake.&quot; &quot;For this is
thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
grief, suffering wrongfully.&quot; &quot;For even hereunto are we
called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an
example that we should follow his steps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
Let us keep in mind, that Jesus Christ was arraigned
before an earthly judge, that he endured indignity, violence
and contempt. Every innocent man who is brought
before a human tribunal, and condemned to perpetual bondage,
when his judge can find no fault in him, may be regarded
as the representative of Him, who replied to Pilate,
&quot;Thou couldst have no power against me, except it were
given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me
unto thee hath the greater sin.&quot; Suffer us to mingle our
sighs, and our tears with yours over these heart-rending
scenes, these ruthless inflictions of nameless and unutterable
woes; but let us remember, that when the Redeemer
of men was taken by a band of armed ruffians, he acted
out his own sublime precept&mdash;&quot;Resist not evil;&quot; and
when Peter with intemperate zeal cut off the servant&#39;s
ear, Jesus healed the wound, and commanded his disciple
to put up his sword again into its place.</p>

<p class="indent">If we recur to the history of God&#39;s chosen people,
whom he permitted to be in bondage in the land of Egypt,
we shall find that it was not when Moses killed the Egyptian
because he smote an Israelite, that the God of the
oppressed arose for their deliverance. No, dear friends,
it was when &quot;the children of Israel sighed by reason of
the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto
God by reason of the bondage. And God heard their
groaning and God remembered his covenant.&quot; Shall we
distrust him now that his covenant of mercy has been
sealed with the blood of his only begotten son&mdash;shall we
resort to weapons forged by Satan, and used by our enemies,
when the Lord God omnipotent is our king, and it
behoveth his subjects to be &quot;shod with the preparation of
the gospel of peace, praying always with all prayer, and
supplication in the Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The eyes of the community are fixed upon you with an
intensity of interest; many watch for your halting, saying,
&quot;peradventure they will be enticed and we shall prevail
against them.&quot; Many while they have a kind of sentimental
desire for your welfare, are anxious to keep you
as they term it, in your proper place, or in other words,
are so much under the dominion of prejudice, that they
shrink at the thought of receiving you as brethren beloved;
they try to persuade themselves that God has created us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
with an instinctive alienation from each other, and excuse
their own sin, by casting a reproach on the character of
Jehovah; they repel the idea that you are in every respect
our equals, and pertinaciously deny you the privileges
of social, religious, and domestic intercourse. We can
feel for them, for most, if not all of us have had to combat
these feelings, and such of us as have overcome them, have
abundant cause to sing hallelujah to our God, and bless his
holy name for our abolition principles; they have opened a
source of heavenly joy in our bosoms, which we would
not exchange for all the gold of Ophir. Let us then cherish
the apostolic precept, &quot;Brethren if a man be overtaken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one
in the spirit of meekness.&quot; There is another class beloved
friends, who are watching you with the most tender
solicitude, whose daily petitions for themselves are mingled
with supplications for you, who feel poignantly the
indignities which are heaped upon you, who ardently desire
your elevation in every way, who rejoice that they
are found worthy to suffer with you, who feel that their interests
are one with yours as Christians, and as Americans,
and who supplicate the Father of Mercies for an increase
of that hallowed feeling, which receives and welcomes
you with joy as brethren and sisters dearly beloved,
and loses in the sense of your manhood, in the remembrance
that we are all one in Christ Jesus, those unhallowed
and factitious distinctions which are eating out the
very vitals of Christianity. This class long for that blessed
and glorious era, when the brother of low degree will
rejoice in that he is exalted, and the brother of high degree
in that he is made low; because then and not till then
the command may go forth to the Church of Christ in
our land &quot;Arise, shine for thy light is come, and the glory
of the Lord is risen upon thee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In contemplating the abolition of slavery, we feel that
you are equally concerned with ourselves, and we entreat
your co-operation, believing that you can and will labor in
it as efficiently as any portion of the community. We
ask you in the name of Him whose precious blood was
shed for us, to come up to the help of the Lord, in whose
work we are engaged. We ask you, in the name of
bleeding humanity, to assist in this labor of love. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
ask you, for the sake of the down-trodden and defiled
image of God, to arise for the help of the poor, and aid in
restoring our brother and our sister to that exalted station,
only a little lower than the angels, which their gracious
Creator assigned them. True&mdash;obloquy, reproach, and
peril, must be encountered by all who stem the torrent of
popular iniquity, the tide of supercilious prejudice, and the
arrogant pretensions of unfounded superiority; but these
we can endure, and count it joy. We are sensible that
our brethren of color have a more difficult and delicate
part to act in this reformation, than their white fellow-citizens;
but we confidently believe, that as their day is,
so their strength will be; and we commend them and the
cause of human rights, in which we are engaged, to Him
who is able to save unto the uttermost all who come unto
God by Him. May he strengthen us to pursue our holy
purposes with the zeal of the Apostles and the spirit of
the Martyrs, consecrating ourselves to this work of faith,
and labor of love, &quot;that we may be found in Christ, not
having our own righteousness which is of the law, but
that which is through the faith of Christ&mdash;the righteousness
which is of God by Faith.&quot;</p>
